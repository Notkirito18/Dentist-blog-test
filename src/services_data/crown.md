  paragraph1: >
    Dental crowns are versatile restorations used to cover teeth that are
    cracked,  
    worn, or weakened by decay. By encapsulating the entire visible portion of
    a  
    tooth above the gum line, crowns restore its strength, shape, and size.  
    Porcelain and ceramic materials provide a lifelike finish, seamlessly
    blending  
    with your natural smile. Crowns not only protect vulnerable teeth but also  
    improve chewing function and overall oral health, giving you confidence in  
    both appearance and performance.
  paragraph2: >
    The crown process begins with a detailed assessment and gentle tooth
    preparation.  
    Impressions are taken to create a precise, custom-fitted cap in our
    advanced  
    lab. While you wait, a temporary crown protects the site. In a follow-up
    visit,  
    your permanent crown is cemented in place. With proper care—regular
    brushing,  
    flossing, and dental checkups—a high-quality crown can last many years,  
    preserving your smile and bite for the long term.
