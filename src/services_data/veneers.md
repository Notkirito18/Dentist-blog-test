  paragraph1: >
    Porcelain veneers are wafer-thin shells designed to cover the front surface
    of  
    teeth, masking imperfections like chips, gaps, or discoloration. Each veneer
    is  
    custom-shaded and shaped to complement your facial features and bite,
    resulting  
    in a natural-looking, harmonious smile.
  paragraph2: >
    The process involves minimal enamel removal, followed by digital
    impressions  
    and temporary veneers while your final restorations are fabricated. Veneers
    bond  
    securely to teeth and resist staining, offering a long-term solution for a  
    radiant, uniform smile. With proper home care and regular checkups, veneers
    can  
    last 10â€“15 years.
