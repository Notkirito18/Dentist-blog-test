  paragraph1: >
    Tooth extractions are performed when a tooth is beyond repair due to
    decay,  
    trauma, or crowding. Our team prioritizes comfort, using local anesthesia
    and,  
    if needed, sedation to ensure a pain-free experience. By removing
    problematic  
    teeth promptly, we prevent infection and protect your overall oral health.
  paragraph2: >
    Following extraction, we provide clear after-care instructions and
    follow-up  
    support to minimize discomfort and encourage rapid healing. Options for  
    replacing extracted teeth—such as bridges, implants, or partial
    dentures—are  
    discussed during your consultation so you can restore full function and
    beauty  
    to your smile.
