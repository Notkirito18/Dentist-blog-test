  paragraph1: >
    Impacted wisdom teeth can cause crowding, pain, and infection if not
    addressed.  
    Our oral surgeons use cone-beam CT imaging to plan precise, minimally
    invasive  
    extractions. Local anesthesia and optional sedation ensure youâ€™re
    comfortable  
    throughout the procedure.
  paragraph2: >
    Post-op care includes clear instructions, pain management, and follow-up
    visits  
    to monitor healing. By removing wisdom teeth at the right time, we prevent  
    complications and preserve the alignment of your natural teeth. Trust our
    team  
    for safe, efficient treatment and the support you need for a rapid,  
    complication-free recovery.
