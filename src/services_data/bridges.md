  paragraph1: >
    Dental bridges offer a permanent solution for missing teeth. Unlike dental
    implants, bridges can replace missing teeth without surgery. And with
    porcelain finishes available, your new tooth could be almost
    indistinguishable from the natural teeth surrounding it. Having a dental
    bridge can boost your confidence in your smile and make day to day
    activities such as eating and talking easier. Replacing a missing tooth can
    also help protect your remaining teeth. When you have gaps, remaining teeth
    may lean over or move into the space, affecting the way you bite. Food can
    also get trapped in spaces, increasing your risk of tooth decay. Dental
    bridges are an investment in your confidence, quality of life and oral
    health.

  paragraph2: >
    Dental bridges replace missing teeth. Specifically, they can replace one
    tooth or a row of missing teeth. As the name implies, this appliance
    literally “bridges the gap” in your smile. Dentists can create custom
    bridges that match the shade of your natural teeth. There are different
    parts that make up a dental bridge: Abutments are the structures that
    support your dental bridge. While the term often refers to natural teeth, it
    can also refer to tiny connector posts used in dental implant-supported
    bridges. Pontics are the artificial (false) teeth that fill in the gap left
    behind by missing teeth. Depending on your situation and the type of bridge
    you receive, your bridge might consist of one or more abutments and one or
    more pontics.
