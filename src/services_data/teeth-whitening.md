  paragraph1: >
    Our in-office whitening uses professional-grade whitening gel and
    specialized  
    light activation to break down deep stains caused by coffee, wine, tobacco,
    and  
    more. Unlike over-the-counter kits, the higher concentration of whitening
    agent  
    under clinical supervision ensures faster, more predictable outcomes with  
    minimal sensitivity.
  paragraph2: >
    Treatment typically takes under an hour, leaving you up to eight shades
    whiter.  
    We customize the tray fit and monitor comfort throughout, then provide take-
    home touch-up kits to prolong your results. Enjoy a dazzling, stain-free
    smile  
    that enhances your confidence and overall appearance.
