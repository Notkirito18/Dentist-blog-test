  paragraph1: >
    Dental implants consist of a biocompatible titanium post that fuses with
    the  
    jawbone, providing a stable foundation for a custom crown. Implants look,
    feel,  
    and function like natural teeth, preserving bone and preventing the sunken  
    appearance that can follow tooth loss. They are ideal for single-tooth or
    full-arch  
    restorations.
  paragraph2: >
    Our implant process uses digital planning and guided surgical guides for
    exact  
    placement. After osseointegration (bone healing), an abutment and crown
    are  
    attached, completing your restoration. With routine care, implants can last
    a  
    lifetimeâ€”delivering reliable performance, comfort, and the confidence of a  
    complete smile.
