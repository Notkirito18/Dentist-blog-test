  paragraph1: >
    Dental fillings restore teeth damaged by decay or minor fractures. We
    remove  
    the infected tissue and fill the void with composite resin—an advanced,
    tooth- colored material that bonds directly to enamel. This minimally
    invasive  
    approach preserves more of your natural tooth structure compared to older  
    methods, delivering both strength and esthetics.
  paragraph2: >
    Composite fillings are cured with a special light, hardening them in
    seconds.  
    The result is a strong, stain-resistant restoration that matches your
    tooth’s  
    shade. Fillings can last many years with proper care, helping you maintain
    a  
    healthy, beautiful smile without visible metal or unsightly edges.
